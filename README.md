Simple Chatbot for Question Answer using JSON as a Data
In this text I demostrate you a simple chatbot creation using JSON as a database using Natural Language Processing Toolkit(NLTK). It's really simple and easy
to implement, with the the file Q_A_Dataset.py you extract the questions and answers from the image of a Computer Based Test where the options are marked as checkmarks 
the correct answer is marked with a white tick in a green box and wrong answer in a white cross in red box. The q_a_chatbot.py uses the uploaded information from the JSON file to give answers of the question asked.
